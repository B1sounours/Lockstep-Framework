Lockstep Framework
------------------------
The Lockstep Framework (LSF) is a framework designed for games that especially need lockstep simulations. It includes a deterministic 2D physics engine, pathfinding, behavior system, and more. LSF is integrated with Unity but can be abstracted away.

Note: Under development by [John Pan](https://github.com/SnpM).

Quick Setup
-----------
Download the entire Lockstep Framework project and import it into your Unity assets.

Locate the Manager prefab in Core/Example/ and add that into your scene. This prefab comes with 3 components attached: LockstepManager, TestManager, and PlayerManager. LockstepManager contains settings for simulation and non-simulation related things that many other pieces of the LSF use.

TestManager is an example of the script you would write to interact with the LSF. It creates an AgentController, creates 256 agents under that AgentController, and adds the AgentController to PlayerManager for the player to interact with that controller. In FixedUpdate and Update, LockstepManager.Simulate () and LockstepManager.Visualize () are called, respectively. These distribute necessary information to the LSF for when to execute frames.

Click play and enjoy the lockstep simulation of group behaviors and collision responses.

Ability Pattern
----------------
Abilities are moddable behaviors that can be easily attached, detached, and moddified on prefab game objects. They follow the following pattern:
- The overridable Initialize() method is called when the agent the ability belongs to is created and initialized. It provides an argument that is the agent the ability belongs to. Because LSF uses object pooling, the Ability must also be reset in Initialize().
- Simulate() is called every single simulation frame.
- Deactivate() is called when the ability's agent is deactivated (i.e. killed). Note that Simulate() will not be called until after Initialize() is called again.

ActiveAbility Pattern
_____________________________
ActiveAbility inherits from Ability and includes all the patterns described above. In addition ActiveAbilitys can be interacted with by players through Commands.
- Execute () is called when a Command is received and activates the ability. This method provides an argument that is the Command responsible for the ability's activation.
- The ListenInput property is the input that the ability listens to. If a Command with the InputCode of ListenInput is received, Execute () is called on the ability.
 
Essential Abilities
-------------------
Currently, only movement with crowd behaviors is implemented. If you'd like to contribute, please explore Core/Game/Abities/Essential/ and help create more essential behaviors (i.e. Health, Energy, Attack, Stop).
